# Keyward Elyra PoC

This project demonstrates deploying Apache Airflow 1.10.15 on Kubernetes for integration with Elyra 3.15.0, including DAG management and runtime orchestration.

## Project Purpose
- Deploy Airflow on Kubernetes for Elyra pipeline execution
- Provide configuration and deployment guides
- Enable reproducible data workflows using Elyra and Airflow

## Repository Structure
- `AIRFLOW.md`: Airflow deployment and management guide
- `Airflow DAG Info.md`: DAG troubleshooting and verification
- `airflow-1.10.15-k8s.yaml`: Airflow deployment manifest
- `elyra-deployment.yaml`: Elyra deployment manifest
- `minio-deployment.yaml`: MinIO deployment manifest
- `pipelines/`: Example pipelines and DAGs
- `tests/`: Test DAGs and scripts

## Prerequisites
- Kubernetes cluster (v1.18+ recommended)
- `kubectl` configured for your cluster
- Helm (for Helm-based deployments)
- Docker (for building custom images, if needed)

## Deployment Instructions

### Deploy Airflow with kubectl
1. Apply the Airflow deployment YAML:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f airflow-1.10.15-k8s.yaml
   ```
2. Monitor deployment status:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n airflow-elyra
   ```
3. Access Airflow UI (port-forward or service exposure as needed).

### Deploy Airflow with Helm
1. Customize `airflow-3.0.1-values.yaml` as needed.
2. Install Airflow:
   ```bash
   helm install airflow -n airflow-elyra -f airflow-3.0.1-values.yaml apache-airflow/airflow
   ```

### Deploy Elyra and MinIO
- Apply `elyra-deployment.yaml` and `minio-deployment.yaml` using `kubectl apply -f ...`

## DAG Management
- DAGs are managed via git-sync or direct volume mounts.
- See `Airflow DAG Info.md` for troubleshooting and verification steps.

## Cleaning Up
To remove the Airflow deployment:
```bash
kubectl delete namespace airflow-elyra
kubectl get namespace airflow-elyra
```

## Troubleshooting
- Check pod logs for errors: `kubectl logs <pod> -n airflow-elyra`
- Ensure all required Kubernetes resources are created
- Verify DAG synchronization and Airflow webserver status

## Configuring Sub-paths for Elyra DAG Repositories

### Current Limitation
Elyra does not natively support specifying sub-paths (such as "your-org/your-repo/subfolder") in the repository configuration for Airflow runtimes. The repository field only accepts the format "your-git-org/your-dag-repo" without additional path components.

### Alternative Approaches
1. **Use Branches Instead of Sub-paths**: Organize different DAG sets or purposes using separate branches (e.g., a "tests" branch) in your repository.
2. **Create a Dedicated Repository**: Maintain a separate repository specifically for DAGs, structuring folders internally as needed.
3. **Modify Airflow Configuration**: Advanced users can:
   - Adjust git-sync container settings to sync a specific subdirectory
   - Configure Airflow to scan for DAGs in specific subfolders within the repository
4. **Use Folder Structure Within Repository**: While Elyra cannot target a sub-path, you can organize DAGs in folders inside your repo. Airflow can be configured to recursively scan these folders for DAGs.

If you require a very specific structure, consider customizing the Airflow Helm chart or deployment manifest to change git-sync settings or the DAG folder path in Airflow.
